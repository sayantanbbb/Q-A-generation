Hello! 
In this project i have built a project to generate Questions and Answers from a piece of text . It can be very usefull teachers to create questions for their students.The project is built on top of python with the website using streamlit . 

## Explaination of the algorithm

## Data 

Code available here :- creating-data.ipynb 

The model is trained on squad dataset . The json format is converted to csv and the data has been preprocessed . For the implementation you can check the file . The squad dataset was loaded from huggingface . 

## Algorithm 

I trained a T5 model which has been released quite recently . It gave me quite good performance on the dataset . After which we use a sliding window approach to generate multple questions , window is the number of words generated by (no of words in text)/(no of questions needed) . Stride percentage denotes by what percent is the window moved . One question is generated by the model on each window . Code :- training-t5-model.ipynb and inference-of-model.ipynb the training file took almost 8 hours to run on kaggle gpu . Less stride can generate more duplicates but also more questions . 


## Demo

as you can see some questions still haded to be manually deleted . Also the filedownloaded wasent recorder so i will just paste the screenshots :-
